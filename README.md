# DiceGame

Assignment:
Need to make a function that "rolls a die" (random number generator)
Need to use 6 different dice (meaning they have a different number of "sides")
Add code to make it a functional game that gives an output
Front-End not required

Comments:

Had many different ideas, but the clicker game was more of nostalgia reasons. 
The dice roll function would be the upgrade function that ran through an array.
I might come back to pretty up the game, but this is the finalized mvp (most viable product(for testing))
