# DiceGame

## Assignment:
* Need to make a function that "rolls a die" (random number generator)
* Need to use 6 different dice (meaning they have a different number of "sides")
* Add code to make it a functional game that gives an output
* Front-End not required

### Comments:

I had many different ideas, but the clicker game was for nostalgia reasons. 

Stack Used: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, Sublime, Git

This was my first project outside of creating a quick portfolio. This project had me implement JavaScript, which at this point we had 2-3 days of learning the material. On top of 2 days of HTML/CSS. 

I went about this thinking: How does the standard clicker game work?
My reference for this is the game Clicker Heroes.

The code entails:
- A health pool for small/medium/large monsters
- An array of the health pools
- Damage upgrades array
- Shop price array
- Variables for all the above
- RNG function for monster health decicison, damage done
- Monster spawn function
- Damage dealt and damage upgrade functions
- Function for on click html action
